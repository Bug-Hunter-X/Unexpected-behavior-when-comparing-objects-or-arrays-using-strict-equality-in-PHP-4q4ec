This repository contains a simple PHP function that demonstrates an uncommon bug related to comparing objects or arrays using strict equality (===). The bug arises because strict equality checks whether two variables refer to the same object in memory, not whether they have the same values.  The solution provides an alternative approach for accurate comparison of objects or arrays.
